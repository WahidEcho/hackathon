# Robin Logistics RL System - Reinforcement Learning Approach

## 🧠 **RL Architecture Overview**

This system implements a **Deep Q-Learning** approach for the Multi-Warehouse Vehicle Routing Problem (MWVRP):

- **State Space**: Environment features (orders, vehicles, inventories, capacities)
- **Action Space**: Vehicle assignment and routing decisions  
- **Reward Function**: Based on fulfillment rate and cost efficiency
- **Algorithm**: Deep Q-Network with experience replay
- **Training**: Episode-based learning with exploration decay

## 🚀 **Quick Start - RL System**

### 1. **Train the RL Model**
```bash
# Quick training (50 episodes)
python train_rl_model.py

# Full training (200 episodes)  
python rl_trainer.py
```

### 2. **Use Trained Model**
```bash
# Test RL solver
python solver.py

# Run with dashboard (loads RL model automatically)
python run_dashboard.py

# Run headless
python run_headless_local.py
```

### 3. **Dashboard Integration**
When you click "**Run Simulation**" in `run_dashboard.py`:
1. **Loads pretrained RL model** (`trained_model.pkl`) 
2. **Encodes current scenario** into state vector
3. **RL policy selects action** based on learned strategy
4. **Converts action to solution** (routes, pickups, deliveries)
5. **Displays results** with standard metrics

## 📊 **RL Training Process**

### **Episode Structure**
```
Each Episode:
1. Generate new logistics scenario  
2. Encode environment state (100 features)
3. RL agent selects actions (50 possible actions)
4. Convert actions to vehicle routes
5. Calculate reward based on performance
6. Update Q-network using experience replay
7. Store experience in memory buffer
```

### **Reward Function** 
Based on your project specification:
```python
reward = W_DELIVER * delivered_items - ALPHA_DIST * distance_penalty + 
         W_UTIL * utilization_bonus - W_VIOLATION * violations + 
         terminal_bonus
```

Where:
- `W_DELIVER = 200.0` (reward per delivered item)
- `ALPHA_DIST = 1.0` (distance penalty)  
- `W_UTIL = 0.1` (utilization bonus)
- `W_VIOLATION = 500.0` (constraint violation penalty)

## 🎯 **How RL Solver Works**

### **State Encoding (100 features)**
- **Basic counts**: Orders, vehicles, warehouses (3 features)
- **Vehicle capacities**: Weight/volume for each vehicle (10 features)  
- **Inventory levels**: Stock levels per warehouse (20 features)
- **Order requirements**: Items needed per order (30 features)
- **Exploration noise**: Random features for exploration (37 features)

### **Action Decoding (50 actions)**
Actions map to different assignment strategies:
- **Assignment strategy**: Round-robin, capacity-based, distance-based
- **Vehicle selection**: Which vehicles to prioritize
- **Order prioritization**: How to sequence orders

### **Solution Generation**
1. **State → Action**: RL model selects best action
2. **Action → Routes**: Decode action into vehicle assignments
3. **Routes → Solution**: Generate pickup/delivery steps
4. **Validation**: Ensure solution follows constraints

## 🔧 **Training Commands**

### **Quick Training** (Ready in 2-3 minutes)
```bash
python train_rl_model.py
```
- 50 episodes
- Basic performance
- Good for testing

### **Full Training** (10-15 minutes)  
```bash
python rl_trainer.py
```
- 200 episodes
- Better performance
- Comprehensive learning

### **Training with Logging**
```bash
MVP_LOG=1 python rl_trainer.py
```
Shows detailed training progress and model decisions.

## 🎮 **Dashboard Integration**

Your **`solver.py`** maintains the exact skeleton structure:

```python
def solver(env) -> Dict:
    """Loads RL model and generates solution"""
    
def my_solver(env) -> Dict:  
    """Alias for dashboard compatibility"""
```

When you run **`python run_dashboard.py`** and click "**Run Simulation**":
1. ✅ **Calls** `my_solver(env)` 
2. ✅ **Loads** pretrained RL model automatically
3. ✅ **Generates** optimized routes using learned policy
4. ✅ **Displays** standard metrics (cost, fulfillment, routes)

## 📊 **Expected Performance**

### **After Quick Training (50 episodes)**
- **Routes**: 8-12 active routes
- **Operations**: 100-200 pickup/delivery operations  
- **Fulfillment**: Moderate (50-80%)
- **Cost**: Reasonable optimization

### **After Full Training (200 episodes)**  
- **Routes**: 10-12 optimized routes
- **Operations**: 150-300 pickup/delivery operations
- **Fulfillment**: High (70-90%)
- **Cost**: Better optimization with learned strategies

## 🚀 **Hackathon Submission**

For submission, your **`solver.py`** file:
1. ✅ **Loads pretrained model** (no training during evaluation)
2. ✅ **Uses learned policy** for route optimization  
3. ✅ **Generates solutions** in required format
4. ✅ **Maintains interface** compatibility with evaluation system
5. ✅ **Falls back gracefully** if model file missing

### **Submission Steps**
```bash
# 1. Train the model
python rl_trainer.py

# 2. Test the system  
python run_dashboard.py

# 3. Rename for submission
cp solver.py {TEAM_NAME}_solver_1.py

# 4. Include model file
# Ensure trained_model.pkl is in same directory
```

## 🧪 **Testing & Validation**

```bash
# Test RL system
python manual_test.py

# Test model loading
python solver.py  

# Test dashboard integration
python run_dashboard.py

# Test headless execution
python run_headless_local.py
```

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### **"No pretrained model found"**
```bash
python train_rl_model.py  # Quick training
```

### **"RL model not available"**  
```bash
pip install numpy  # Ensure numpy is available
python rl_trainer.py  # Retrain model
```

### **Poor performance**
```bash
# Try longer training
python rl_trainer.py  # 200 episodes instead of 50

# Enable logging to debug
MVP_LOG=1 python run_dashboard.py
```

## 🎯 **Key Advantages**

1. **🧠 Learned Optimization**: RL discovers strategies through experience
2. **🎯 Adaptive**: Learns from diverse scenarios during training  
3. **⚡ Fast Inference**: Quick prediction once model is trained
